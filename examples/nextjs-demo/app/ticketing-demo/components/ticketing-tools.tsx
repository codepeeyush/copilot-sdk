Thank you for being upfront about your situation - I really appreciate that, and I want to help find a solution that works for both you and your team.

I took a look at your account and I can see you've been with us for almost 5 years - that's incredible, and we truly value your partnership. I also noticed that while you're on the Pro plan, you're mainly using the Analytics and API features.

${

    ? `Here's what I can do for you:

I'd like to offer you a **25% discount on your Pro plan** for the next 12 months. That brings your monthly cost from $49 to $36.75 - which is actually below our Basic plan price, but you'd keep full API access and Analytics that your team relies on.

This way, you can show your manager a meaningful cost reduction while keeping the features you need. Would this work for your budget goals?`

Would you have a few minutes to chat about what might work best?`
