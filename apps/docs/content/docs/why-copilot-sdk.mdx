# Why Copilot SDK?

Building AI assistants shouldn't require a team of ML engineers and months of development. Yet that's exactly what most solutions demand.

<Callout type="info">
**Ship in hours, not months.** From zero to production-ready AI copilot with 3 lines of code.
</Callout>

## The Problem with Existing Solutions

Most AI copilot solutions fall into two camps—and both have serious drawbacks:

### SaaS Platforms (Intercom, Zendesk AI, etc.)

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Your AI, your data, their servers. Good luck migrating. |
| **Limited Customization** | Pre-built widgets that don't match your brand or UX |
| **Per-seat Pricing** | Costs explode as you scale |
| **No Code Access** | Can't extend, can't debug, can't own |
| **Data Privacy Concerns** | Customer conversations on third-party servers |

### DIY with Raw LLM APIs

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Months of Development** | Building streaming, tools, context, UI from scratch |
| **No Context Awareness** | AI has no idea what's on the user's screen |
| **Complex State Management** | Conversation history, tool calls, agentic loops |
| **Multi-provider Headache** | Different APIs, different formats, different quirks |
| **Maintenance Burden** | Every API change breaks your implementation |

## Built for Speed

### What Takes Others Weeks, Takes You Minutes

```tsx
// Step 1: Wrap your app (30 seconds)
<CopilotProvider runtimeUrl="/api/chat">
  <App />
</CopilotProvider>

// Step 2: Add the chat (30 seconds)
<CopilotChat />

// Step 3: You're done. Ship it.
```

**That's a production-ready AI copilot.** With streaming, conversation history, and beautiful UI.

Want more? Add context awareness in one line:

```tsx
<CopilotProvider
  tools={{ screenshot: true, console: true }}
/>
```

Now your AI can see screenshots and read console errors. Try doing that with Intercom.

## Full Code Ownership

### No Black Boxes

Every line of code is yours to inspect, modify, and extend:

- **Fork and customize** - Don't like something? Change it.
- **Debug with confidence** - Full stack traces, no mystery APIs
- **Extend freely** - Add custom tools, providers, UI components
- **No dependency risk** - Service goes down? You still have the code.

### Open Architecture

```tsx
// Custom tool? Easy.
useToolWithSchema({
  name: 'custom_action',
  schema: z.object({ /* your schema */ }),
  handler: async (params) => {
    // Your logic, your way
  }
});

// Custom provider? Done.
import { createCustomProvider } from '@yourgpt/llm-sdk';

// Custom UI? Of course.
import { useCopilotChat } from '@yourgpt/copilot-sdk/react';
// Build whatever UI you want with the hook
```
