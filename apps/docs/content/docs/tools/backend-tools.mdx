# Backend Tools

Execute tools securely on your backend with access to databases, APIs, and secrets.

## Why Backend Tools?

| Frontend Tools | Backend Tools |
|---------------|---------------|
| Run in browser | Run on server |
| User can inspect | Code stays private |
| No secrets access | Full secrets access |
| Limited capabilities | Database, APIs, files |

Backend tools are perfect for:
- Database queries and mutations
- Calling internal microservices
- External API integrations with secret keys
- File operations and data processing

Detailed documentation coming soon.
